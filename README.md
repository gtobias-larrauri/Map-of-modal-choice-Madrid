This repository contains a map of commutes in the city of Madrid created Dec 2023.

It is an interactive map that uses folium.

MAP_URBAN.ipynb file contains the code as well as, a brief interpretation of the results of the map and the geospatial data engineering required to make it.

MAP.html is the interactive map.  It's on commutes that originate in a given neighbourhood of the city of Madrid. 
In the top right corner and you can activate and deactivate layers of the map (please do so because the map doesn't make sense with all layers open)
I am working on how to visualize it better here using github pages, it can be downloaded and opened with chrome for now.

EDM2018VIAJES.dta contains a raw stata file with all the trips as well as other variables.

This repository does not contain the geographical data as it is quite heavy
